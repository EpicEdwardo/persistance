var pynchon = "Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity Rainbow , features a romance between characters Roger and Jessica. Early on in the book, the two, find momentary solace amidst the disaster of the Second World War, isolated from the world in an abandoned house, holding each other in one another's arms as they watch a sunset over Germany. Pynchon points out that war 'subvert[s] love in favor of work, abstraction, required pain, bitter death.'   Pynchon’s response to the state of war is an ode of an irresponsible solipsism: “They are in love. Fuck the war. ” For Pynchon, the lovers choose their own little world over the world. They choose the sensuality of one another's bodies over the abstraction of military tactics. They choose the joy of the Other's presence over the isolation that comes from work and death. <br /> <br />" +
	"In a time of crisis, the persistence of love often comes at the expense of the world itself. If love is in part a deferral to the Outside, love also contains within it a contradiction in which the lovers owe their existence of love due to outside circumstances, but that those same lovers can renounce any debt to an ethical engagement towards the Outside for the sake of love. Another example, not from Pynchon but from The Matrix trilogy. Near the end of Matrix Reloaded , Neo is told by the Architect that he has to choose between two doors: the first, saving Trinity, Neo’s love interest, and the second, saving all of mankind from destruction via machines. Now, without trying to explain what Matrix Reloaded is about, the essential point is that Neo puts his personal love for Trinity over the fate of mankind. The Architect, commenting on this notes the ways in which love is radically irrational. Love is irrationally rational and rationally irrational. It makes no sense to save one’s love interest at the expense of the world itself: destroying the world means destroying the lover. At the same time, it makes no sense to save the world if it means losing those one loves. It is a choice which has no easy answer.<br /> <br />" +
	"The either/or situation of both Gravity’s Rainbow and The Matrix: Reloaded is in part a social construction of love’s role in larger human projects under capitalism. That is, capitalism privatizes love affairs, making the value they generate (refer to the labor theory of love), unable to be reintegrated into modern society. Love can change the world, but our social conditions privatize love, making us unable to imagine the way it can change the world. That is why we need faith in love that can think forward to a future which cannot be thought forward to yet. The two options—the War and Love, the door that saves humanity and the door that saves Trinity—are based on a conflict between one’s debt to humanity and one’s love for another. But we propose a third door—a third pill, to use Matrix terminology."
   var cavell = "Love is caught in a dilemma, characterized by an idealization of the Other, but concerned with an encounter with the Real, with the Other who eludes any fantasy or ideal image of them. For although love and fantasy go hand and hand, it is in the moments when the fantasy subsides and the lovers encounter the real ugliness of one another that a “true” love begins. Yet, for the persistence of love to happen, there must be a level of scripting and performativity. Closeness in a day-to-day sense is characterized by stock replies and in-jokes shared between the Two. It is a play, where both the lovers have the capacity to memorize and perform the scripts they have written for one another. These scripts are flexible and open to change: one lover may perform masculinity one day and then the next perform femininity, one may perform cuteness one day and then eroticism the next. A constant encounter with another’s Real, day in and day out, would be unfeasible: the scripts lovers play allows for a multiplicity of roles in which the lovers can play for one another, thereby opening up more possibilities of being together through the play of scripts with one another. An over-identification with a script (say, of femininity or masculinity) can spell disaster for love precisely because it would confuse one’s Real with a fundamentally socially constructed phenomenon. When we start believing that we are the role we are inhabiting, like an actor convinced they are the character they play, we run the risk of being blind to the ways our scripts are constructed by ideology. Yet we all over-identify with certain scripts. The difficulty of playing scripts is deciding the degree of apathy we hold towards each script: discerning which scripts “you” believe reflect you more. Performance in love is a landscape of negotiating and (de)recognizing the scripts the Other plays. <br /> <br />" +
	"Nevertheless, the persistence of love benefits from scripts. In the world the two lovers build, they must make room for theatre. After all, creating a world together without play is not any world one wants to be part of. Cute gestures become a form of anti-drama that ground love against the dramatics of love—in the heat of a fight, the slight gesture can prevent an explosion from occurring. The sign of mature lovers is their capacity for immaturity. Stanley Cavell shows through the film genre he calls the comedy of remarriage that love brings us back to a condition of childhood.  He further connects Kant's idea of the aesthetic experience as a site of 'directedness without direction'  with the play of childhood that lovers can embody through love. For Cavell, laughter becomes a 'physical requirement' of 'wedded love.'  We get a whole host of a theatrics that make up the ways of play lovers engage in the “Comedy” of Remarriage: double entendres, word plays, and slap-stick comedy. These theatrics are the basis of love in the films Cavell analyzes. <br /> <br />" + 
	"The scripts lovers play become sites of mutual creativity where lovers share a mutual understanding of a system of gestures. They emerge spontaneously out of chance encounters between one another. That is, the Two will discover gestures together which will allow them to persist in love. The in-joke, after all, is like a line of poetry constructed between Two. It is a form of creating from the point of Two. As such, part of love’s persistence is the skill at which lovers can perform and play scripts together. What the persistence of love connects to is the constant self-reflection of whether we like the scripts we are performing or whether or not we want to fine-tune them while maintaining fidelity with the Other. This courage of shifting one's scripts is an act outside of scripting itself: it is the moment when the Real of love emerges. The will to change a script and its economy of signs is endlessly difficult. Then there is the question of whether love is a script itself. After all the gifts of flowers, the soft-spoken tones and the endless gestures of affection are plays we perform for the Other are all scripted out events imposed on us by society. <br /> <br />"
  
var world = "If love is 'an existential project' that 'construct[s] a world' from the decentered point of view between lovers instead of one's will to impose their identity on the world , then that constructed world also ends up constructing the lovers. I mean this primarily in two ways which I will sketch out here: <br /><br />" +
"(1) The commitment to the truth of love and the construction of a world with the Other causes us to change alongside this world. <br /> <br />" +
"First, love changes the way we think through a thinking of love itself. This is taken up in a bulk of the first chapter on the insistence of love and on the idea of a thinking of love. Note that even when we are no longer in love, that way of thinking has shaped us in a particular way: it has opened new possibilities for thinking of our being. Second, some expressions of love (for example, if you can pardon my conservatism, the birth of a child) demand that we change ourselves (adopting a “parent” script) in order to keep being truthful to a particular expression of love. That is, the way we navigate obstacles we encounter with our lover shapes the way we become. We gain experiences with love that change how we experience. <br /> <br />" +
"(2) The world unconsciously structures love. <br /> <br />" +
"This point will be taken up at length in our discussion of love's poverty, and the politics of love, but essentially the world propagates messages about love and beauty which end up shaping both our gaze and the ways we interact with our lover. Love under capital is a love which exists under the constant stream of content: as long as there is something new to do—a new vacation area, a new movie in theatres and so on, love keeps going because life is what keeps going, what keeps being fed to us. Zygmunt Bauman points out that the rise of the smart phone makes “introspection” and silence in our interactions impossible.   With texting culture, not only are we fed a constant stream of content, we must always be producing content for our beloved, to the point where our words to the Other serve only to 'keep the chat going.'  This constant stream of content ends up shaping our love and what we expect of love. Love in the day-to-day is a love of non-stop activity. <br /> <br />" +
"Of course the world can consciously structure love as well: Those under the jurisdiction of homophobic or racist laws know that the world can threaten love. As well, Symbolic laws which both lovers follow will shape their relations. That is, a lover will follow a script of Masculinity or Femininity (or in less hetereonormative terms either be a dominant or a submissive) that acts as a Third Term that shapes love--this is taken up in the section on scripts and performativity. <br /><br />" +
"But I hope to shift thinking about the Third Term of love with regards to Symbolic functions here and understand the ways in which the world as material shapes our love. Work on this has been done. For example, Luce Iragaray's work on the potentiality of considering the breath of love as occurring before the words of love in her chapter 'A Breath that Touches in Words,' in I love to you,  with which figures such as Kelly Oliver in 'The Look of Love' grapple. To think of love and the world outside of a world of constant stimulation, we can look at love in the moments of the breath. That is, the lover's breath, the lover's silence, these moments too, speak about love through non-speaking. Nevertheless, I am proposing the agency of the world at large, not only breath, but temperature and weather to also factor in to love. The world gives us space to love: it is the space where love materializes. The world itself is a force that allows love to flourish or threaten love. On the one hand the world threatens love to the extent that a common lover's fantasy is to be barred from the world, hidden in the lover's arms in the darkness of the bedroom, away from the constant bustle of the world.  Yet at the same time, the world allows love to flourish. Stanley Cavell, writing on Hollywood movie The Awful Truth, accentuates the importance of weather in bringing Lucy (Irene Dunn) and Jerry (Cary Grant) back together. Calling the wind, 'wind ex studio machina,'  he points out how it is through the wind which forces open the door that separates Lucy and Jerry which ends up allowing them to get back together. In the lived experiences of everyday life, happenstance allows the Other me to meet the Other. In the snow and the flowers, I am reminded of my love. My heart swells when I see something in their resemblance. In the coldness of winter, I come to my love for warmth and thus warm my heart, enflaming it like a fireplace. The world, in its natural unfolding, breaks me, allowing my love to come inside me and breathe within me. <br /><br />" 

  
 var possesion = "The ground of love is absence. In every moment of love, there is a “missing” of the Other—one cannot truly hold or grasp another: we can never know what the Other is thinking, nor where we truly stand in relation to the Other. The Other is lost, and love brings forth the knowledge of their permanent loss to us. All love is lost love—when we love we lose in that instance of love. In this sense, love curates an anxiety of what is “missing”—either I am “missing” you right now, I am “missing” a signal I want you to send to me, or I am “missing” an aspect of our relationship. Roland Barthes points out that waiting is the \"Tumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being, subject to trivial delays. <br /><br />"+
 "For Barthes, to be in love is to wait: 'The lover's fatal identity is precisely: I am the one who waits.'  Radically, the lover never fully arrives: they never “fully” come to us, there is always a lack to how we relate to them.<br /><br />"+
"In the initial stages of love, we are overcome with an anxiety in not knowing how the Other will react to our love and what our relationship to the Other is, afflicted by what François-René  de Chateaubriand would call ‘the vagueness of the passions’  – that is, love is an intense passion that is coupled with a deep uncertainty of how to make sense of that passion. It is a place where we are uncertain of the relations we have with the Other. Love intensifies the feeling of the hole Other leading to affective states of ‘missing,’ and constituting a bubbling ground for anxiety. <br /><br />"+
"To soothe this anxiety, we introduce “possession” into love. Possessing the Other, becomes the medicine to cure the lack of love. We form a set-upon agreement as to how our interactions with the Other will look (‘we get in a relationship’) to defer to a larger set of codes as to how we can navigate our love with another. In a word, we, after knowing that our lover loves us the way we want to be loved and we love them the way they want to be loved, agree upon a stable set of norms to navigate our desires with one another. This is possession in its healthiest sense. When, however, possession is excessive—that is, when there is a fixation on owning the Other, on confining the Other to only show love to oneself, or better put, to try and erase any of the lack and “missing” of the Other, then we get jealousy. However, even if being in a relationship with the Other might quench the initial anxiety of being unsure of missing the Other, it does not stop the missing of the Other. In the later stages of love, we are overcome in an anxiety of not knowing who the Other “truly” is, or whether our passion for the Other will continue to stay. When we possess the Other, we still find ourselves lacking something in love: we find out, in a Lacanian twist, that no matter what, we will feel something lacking. The difference between the jealousy a lover faces and the empty lack they feel once they “possess” the Other is the difference between an obsessive lack and a melancholic lack.<br /><br />"+
"In this way, we offer to think of a love not grounded on possession in its dealing of ‘lack.' Yet to allow love to be completely “free” is not the point here: that is, we want to think past the dynamic of love and possession and think through instead, the ways love and its lack can be dealt with through other orientations.<br /><br />"+ 
"Henri Lefebvre traces out the myth of non-possession in which “promiscuity, infidelity, the absence of jealousy, become signs of freedom, of [a] new love, of the emancipated 'feminine personality'.”  For Lefebvre, this myth of non-possession is a type of love which states a relationship “will be richer, more human, more complex, more joyful (but also possibly more deeply painful) with someone who is free than with someone who allows him or herself to be 'possessed.'”  His central critique of the myth of non-possession is that it places love in the sphere of the ‘private.’ The type of non-possessive love simply states that a lover, as a “private” entity cut off from the social world, does not possess another lover. But this type of love is a type of solipsism from the world and the world-building project endemic in love. Lefebvre wants love to go further than private sexual relations.  For Lefebvre, he wants to go past the binary of possession and non-possession and allow love to flourish as two free beings whose “physiological, psychological, ‘spiritual’ relation[s]” will “enter everyday life” allowing love to “impregnate the other human relations (social activities, thought, etc.), which henceforth will be accomplished through them, but not without them.”  In other words, Lefebvre imagines love as being integrated into the social world itself. Whereas questions of possession are framed in the personal level, where love can really make a mark is in the social world, where lovers are free, not free from the jealousy of one another, but free to allow their love to transform the world. <br /><br />"+
"In this way, the de-recognition of love is a technique to help realize Lefebvre’s vision.  Instead of dealing with the anxiety of lack in love through possessing the lover, we are humble in the face of the lack, deferring (or perhaps sublimating) the lack of love into forms of poetry or into an invocation of doing good. In love we are possessed by the lover but can never possess them. This disparity between desiring to own a lover but never fully having them produces a productive lack that can be deferred outwards to the world (forming the grounds for love's labor). Whereas Lefebvre’s vision is that lovers’ who are completely free will be able to transform the world, my vision is that lovers’ who understand that they will always lack one another will use that awareness of their anxiety as a drive to transform the world.  <br /><br />"
 
 var everyday = "Another entanglement, this one not between l’amour fou and love as freedom, but l’amour fou and banality: or as Karl Jasper would put, between ‘the Passion of the Night’ and the ‘Norm of the day.’  How can love persist in the everyday? One answer to the mundanity of love is the recognition that love is not all emotive ecstasy, but that an important component to love is the ways it manifests when one is not feeling “in” love. According to John of the Cross,  “a soul comes to love God without any longer feeling its love.”  We can imagine a similar framework in love wherein lovers manage to love without the feeling of love. In many senses, to love without the feeling of love is to love in such a way that accounts for the boredom of life in love. But in this boredom, the lover is not bored of their lover but bored with their lover: they allow for boredom (or perhaps affectlessness) to be part of the world-building project of love. <br/><br/>" +
	"Max Brod says that 'passionate love desires ‘the faraway princess’ but Christian love is directed to ‘our neighbour.’  Love turns into a relation similar to our relation with our neighbors: i.e. in terms of mutual co-existence, endurance and peace  as opposed to an expression of deep passions. Love does not need to always be a feeling together, but can be each other creating a space for one another, independently, to grow the way they need to grow. Eva Illouz points out that the concept of the 'relationship' is a new cultural framework for viewing love that emerges out of modernity.  The relationship acts as a Third Term in love. That is, lovers may be madly in love, but if their relationship does not “work” then they cannot stay together. Significantly, Illouz points out that the relationship is judged based off how smoothly the “scripts” of a relationship run with respect to the 'hedonic principles [of] pleasure and well-being.'  That is to say, the Third term of love with regards to the relationship are the scripts of emotional labor lovers exercise in order to keep 'working.' The end goal of this labor in keeping the relationship going is ultimately the mutual pleasure and well-being of each other. In this way, once the relationship becomes “stagnant” or “boring,” it, through a value judgment, is not worth putting in labor. Yet, could not boredom become the site of another stage of love? We are no opponent to a mundane and “boring” love. The techniques to keep love going in modern society of course are captured by Erich Fromm in The Art of Loving. Now, Fromm points out that capitalism makes us think of love in use-value , and that for us to re-invent love we must practice love as an action and not as a feeling. Fromm points out that practicing love means doing the hard work of 1) concentrating and not distracting ourselves nor generating use-value we can exchange in our relations , 2) disciplining ourselves to concentrating  and 3) having faith in ourselves that we will continue to see people objectively and not in terms of use value.  However, this project wants to go beyond Fromm's persistence of love which only serves to allow love to survive in the private sphere. Our persistence of love should be directed outwards to exercise both lovers' autonomy against the world, to allow the emotional labor in love to affect the world itself. I want to think through the development of develop scripts for 'the relationship' which can simultaneously allow a relationship to persist but also for the two lovers to persist against the world. It is through a practice of conceiving of a love day-by-day that subverts our default neoliberal way of thinking of love. It is the site of the everyday, the space of diurnal encounters with each other that our knowledge of each other is constituted: 'the knowledge of others depends upon an appreciation of their repeating.'  As such, understanding the diurnal is the breeding ground for encountering the Other also means understanding the ways we entangle our concept of the diurnal and the Other. In understanding the relationship the diurnal has with the Other, we can re-invent or re-constitute our thinking past ideological control societies. By thinking of love, we not only reject love as presented in our late capitalist vision, but substitute that vision of love with a re-invented love. Moreover, we re-invent love every day: this requires discipline and concentration, it requires an eye towards a cultural critique of love as well as a creative poesis of love which allows for a space for physis to shape that poesis. <br/><br/>" +
"It seems to me that introducing terms such as 'every-day' into love inevitably lead us to think of boredom and love. Now my hope is that we can entangle discipline and concentration in love with a boredom in love: that boredom is not a toxin of modern life we ought to distract ourselves from, but a space where a re-invention of love can occur. While most love stories are presented in the form of the Hollywood Romantic comedy , the potentiality of a love emergent from slow cinema becomes a ground for contemplating new possibilities of love in modern life. This project of showing a slow cinema of love is an avenue of further study, which I hope to take up at some future date. <br/><br/>" +
	"Crucially, I do not want to suggest that love in the everyday is some endurance of intense boredom. It seems clear to me that a persistence of love rather prefer its lovers engage in activities which they both find pleasurable and good. That is, it is better in the long run for a lover to do something which is good for them while simultaneously being good for their beloved than for the lover to constantly being doing something, which although may be a sign of love towards the beloved, exhausts them on the day-to-day basis. What I want to suggest the possibility of studying the ways slow cinema can provide us this mutual growth in both the lover and beloved that could supplant the normative practices of everyday life.<br/><br/>"

 
   var zizek = "Slavoj Žižek points out in an article titled ‘How to renounce your passion: A Hegelian lesson on the ethics of marriage’  that during the Bolshevik revolution, a new form of love emerged. In this form, the love couple lives ‘in a permanent state of emergency, totally dedicated to the revolutionary Cause, ready to sacrifice all personal sexual fulfillment to it, even ready to abandon and betray each other if the Revolution demanded it, but simultaneously totally dedicated to each other, enjoying rare moments together with extreme intensity.’<br />" +
	"<br />For Žižek, love co-exists with an engagement of political projects in the world.  The personal and the political go hand and hand. Although the personal is not the political in Žižek’s vision. Instead, love and political action are kept as two separate spheres that are radically apart. However, that radical apartness makes it possible for love and politics to exist side by side.<br/><br/>" +
	"Žižek argues, ‘the radical disjunction between sexual passion and social-revolutionary activity is fully recognized. The two dimensions are accepted as totally heterogeneous, each irreducible to the other, there is no harmony between the two — but it is this very recognition of the gap that makes their relationship non-antagonistic.’" + "<br/><br/>" + 
	"In this way, the phrase ‘They’re in love. Fuck the war.’ is telling. Pynchon has to separate the statement ‘Fuck the war’ from ‘They’re in love’ with a period. The two thoughts are only related in so far as they are separate. To pursue love means to ignore one’s duty. Likewise, to fulfill one’s duties is to ignore love. Though perhaps one day our material conditions will allow us to theorize further the possibility of love and politics past their separation.  I want to suggest the possibility of the role of love in society where a statement like ‘They’re in love—Fuck the War.’ can be generated. That is, where proclaiming love to another can change the world itself. After all, Barthes, calls love an obscenity.  It is now the space to think through how this obscenity of love can be used to change our conditions and conditioning. Perhaps the phrase ‘the personal is the political’ with respect to love refers to a utopian ideal in which one’s love for one another can be a political statement that changes the world itself. ‘They’re in love. Fuck the war.’ can mean something different than choosing the personal over the political. Perhaps, it could mean the ways lovers fuck the war is to rebel against (not ignore) the war in their passionate embrace." 

	var deRouge = "One of the most impressive accounts of an historical analysis of love is Denis De Rougemont’s <i>Love in the Western World</i>, a sprawling book that argues the myth of Tristan and Iseult is embedded in the West’s conception of love." +	 
"<br /><br />De Rougemont starts his book in the “background of paganism out of which the Tristan myth sprang”  through an analysis of the myth’s religious origins, starting its development through ritual with the Manicheans.  He most significantly grounds his thesis in an analysis of the Troubadours and their development of courtly love, which can be summarized by Guiraut Riquier, “sometimes referred to as the last of the troubadours” who writes “the five doors [of love] are Desire, Prayer, Service, Kissing, and Doing, whereby Love perishes.”  For De Rougemont, Arthurian romance (read, Tristan) comes from this conception of courtly love alongside Celtic myths.  Now it should be noted that this summary of De Rougemont does erase several of the nuances in his text. For one, he does not think love’s development in the West has a straightforward narrative. For example, he splits up multiple philosophies of love and shows how they intersect throughout Western history: troubadours elevate passion on the one hand, but the Platonists reject sensuality in favor of reason, yet nevertheless both viewpoints meet in the battleground of love through a figure like Dante." + 
"<br /><br />From the religious origins of love, De Rougemont points out that when “myths lose their esoteric character and their sacred purpose they take on a literary form.”  As a result, he turns his analysis to Western literature from the 13th century all the way to the 20th century and argues that literature carries with it the Tristan myth all throughout the ages.  But looking at love in literature is not just an exercise in literary criticism. De Rougemont points out, “following La Rochefoucauld, that few people would fall in love had they never heard of love.”  In other words, the “latent feelings” of love are shaped by “certain linguistic conventions” which we best can bring out through an analysis of literature.  We are taught how to love by cultural notions we have of love. Those cultural notions of love, as De Rougemont has shown come from a lineage of thought tracing back to the 13th century." +  
"<br /><br />Here we add that love is a linguistic term used to describe affective states we occupy that we can classify as love. We build a love “story” by assigning a grander meaning to make sense of the several momentary meanings of each affective “love” state we are in. These affective states themselves may not be socially constructed, but deciding to classify them as love is. As a result, feelings of friendship and fondness may be excluded from feelings of ‘true love’, but only because of our constructed notion of love."

var politicsoflove = "Love does not erase difference but intensifies it. For Alain Badiou love is 'the construction of the world on the basis of difference' --it is the procedure of navigating the world not from our own narcissism but through the intersubjectivity of another. Michael Hardt advocates a thinking about love which constructs a constellation among differences (including but not limited to social differences) with one another.  I would add that in that difference we find that each lover is bound to different political conditions. Our experience of culture is not universal. This means that, especially within the context of the multicultural state of things today, love poses questions of differences: not just personal or social-political differences but also ontic ones. That is, the different ways the Other loves one, and the different conceptions they have of love that come from their different conditions forces each love Encounter to re-invent itself (see more in love without ideal).<br /> <br />" +
"In difference, love becomes a form of violence to yourself. That is, love resists dominant ideology by forcing one to go through a painful procedure of (political) change for the sake of their partner. Our lover demands us to listen, to react to their call in a different way than we do in our default (and thus ideologically constructed) way. The lover occupies (oftentimes) a different class, gender, or race position than us and thus we must listen to the particular material struggles they go through. We must become intimate with a different political condition than the one we occupy. Love persists by insisting on “us” to persist in “our” conditions. <br /> <br />" +
"Though let me raise one point of skepticism towards difference as the source of political potentiality in love. Eva Illouz points out that love is not a 'haven from the market place' but ends up being 'complicit with the political economy of late capitalism.'  Slavoj Žižek shows in his analysis of the movie Titanic, that it is not so much a story of how love conquers class, but shows how insidiously class permeates love. Žižek argues that if Rose and Jack ended up together, Rose would indulge Jack's lower-class existence before realizing she much rather prefers the comfort of her bourgeois life-style and would leave Jack to go back to her former life.  What is happening in Rose and Jack's love affair for Žižek is Rose's fetishization of lower class life. I would add that there is a second level of fetishization occurring with Jack, in which he fetishizes Rose's upper class life. He desires Rose in part because she is in the upper class the same way Rose desires Jack because he is in the lower class. In this way, though they may both be in love, they also both are attracted to each other's different social conditions as it provides a way out of their empty current social existence under modernity. In other words, difference in love becomes an escape for lovers as opposed to a call for change, becoming re-inscribed into a system of power. Such a love says 'look,  I am with someone outside the expected social-cultural position and this makes me more powerful.' The prospect of gaining social capital, either  by being with someone “up” from you or fetishizing their differences, is tied to the recognition of someone else. It is about recognizing the ways we reduce people to use-value in our recognition. We de-recognize in so far as we realize in every recognition, there is always a reducing of the Other to a value in our social capitalistic system. We understand that our lover and our relations with them will always be in this system of power, but move past that and find a new basis for our love that challenges our political conditioning. <br /> <br />" +
"That said, crucially, I do not want to propose a love which is too political—that is, love wherein lovers are too overtly anxious of one another’s political chains. Love still needs, in the end, actual loving. In many cases, that loving might go explicitly against larger political agendas which the lovers’ hold in their social lives.  This raises questions of how to engage in a project of political love. We are in the midst of formulation, as theorist such as Michael Hardt, Lauren Berlant, and many more continue to think through the political potentialities of love. Meanwhile, feminist theorist such as Luce Irigaray in I love to you and bell hooks in The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love explore love in light of gender. Then we have the possibility of thinking about love and politics through the animal. After all, as Jennifer Fay points out in animal films like Winged Migration, a de-anthropomorphized gaze offers us a perspective of the world not bound by human politics of containment.  I do not have much to add except love’s labor and potential uses of de-recognition in a political project of love."

var unconditional = "\"The measure of due love is to be without measure\" - Saint Bernard of Clairvaux <br /><br />" +  
"Saint Bernard of Clairvaux summarizes a tendency in thinking of love (ever present in the Christian tradition) which elevates unconditional love as the highest form of love. There is Freud's lengthy critique of the notion of universal love in Civilization and its Discontent, but most of the critiques of unconditional love are generally very commonsensical. Firstly, though there is part of ourselves that wants to be loved unconditionally, there is a part of ourselves which wants to be loved for what we do and for our accomplishments. Secondly, an unconditional love that is freely given to everyone makes love less special to us. We do not just want to be loved, we want to be special to that person who loves us. Finally, similar to parts of the first and second, unconditional love removes the singularity of a person. That is to say, if we love someone unconditionally, then we love that person erased from their singularity and thus the way we love them is the same way we would love anybody else. In that way, the lover you love unconditionally is endlessly iterable. As a result, the lover you love unconditionally is not the lover you love for them but the lover you love because it allows you to love Love. This type of loving love, as Roland Barthes points out, entails accepting that what one weeps for in the loss of love is not the other who is lost but simply the loss of love.  It is a love for the abstract concept of love and not on a real encounter with another.  <br /><br />" +  
"Though we can see that my endless talk of conditions is allowing another critique of unconditional love to emerge: namely, that unconditional love erases political and material conditions we are bound within. Despite unconditional love's subversive origins, it has resulted in advocating a bourgeois love. Those who purport to love “blind” seldom do: they are simply unaware of how political conditions shape who and how they love. As a result, love ought to integrate itself in discourses of conditions. In love, my lover is called to be attentive to my conditions--both my affective conditions (how 'I am') but also my material and political conditions (how factors of race, gender and class constitute how I am). Nevertheless the spirit of unconditional love is important. We need to be unconditionally loved or we will always have this pressure put on us to be doing something in order to be worthy of love. This constant demand to be “worthy” of love suffocates us as it prevents us from taking risk in fear of losing what makes us worthy of love. Instead of replacing unconditional love with a type of love that is evaluating the lover, I am proposing a love which captures the spirit of unconditional love but expands the possibility of loving without measure with a love that questions the very nature of how we measure, with how we think of love and measure love itself--a love without ideals. "

var poverty = "The politics of love lead us to the poverty of love. That is, to an analysis of the ways in which our political conditions produce poverty in love itself. Just as an examination of poverty in society is a survey of the ways dominant structures of society produce poverty, so to, do we look at the ways our current political condition produces the state of love’s poverty. <br /><br />" +
"Critics of love, such as Lauren Berlant, who argues in Desire/Love that love tends 'to be white, Western, heterosexual, and schooled to the protocols of “bourgeois” privacy; that these tacit proprieties have been used to justify the economic and physical domination of nations, races, religions, gays, lesbians, and women'  and that we should be careful in what we consider ‘true love.’ Berlant points out the ways love itself has been integrated into the system of capitalistic inequality. De Rougemont further points out that love results in a ‘standardized beauty’ and that “a man who falls passionately in love with a woman whom he alone finds beautiful is supposed to be a prey to [the collective’s] nerves.”  That is, love puts clear pressure on people to fit an image of what is worthy of being loved. Instead of us being able to love to ‘our hearts’ content’ we find that our hearts' content is in part formed by the socio-cultural image we are told we should love. To write about the persistence of love means to try in part to escape the Western, white, middle-class construction of a flourishing romance which has been so embedded in our culture.  <br /><br />" +
"In the second season of Atlanta, in the episode 'Champagne Papi,'  one of Van’s friends castigates a white women dating a black man at a party.  She says she’s “just tired of that story” of the white women having a “black man accessory.”  Interestingly, the white women responds that she might just be “a good women.”  She explains that she’s been with the man since “he was doing community theater,” cooking, cleaning and supporting him since the start.  Van’s friend responds that the white women “got all the advantages in the world to be a good women.”  Meanwhile, Van’s friend doesn’t have the resources or time to spend with one man daydreaming about making it in community theater.   <br /><br />" +
"Van’s friend’s criticism is that the white women was given the material tools to live comfortably with her partner and to have the model relationship they have now. The couple overcame adversity when they stuck together through the man’s community theater days, but they had the tools beforehand to overcome that adversity. They have a relationship of love where the anxiety of living life and making it through day by day—persistence—is irrelevant to love itself. This love, though honorable, is also classist. It raises questions of whether people only “truly” love one another because they were raised privileged enough to love.  <br /><br />" +
"Nevertheless, the poverty of love points out that though there might seem to be a lack of love, there can in fact, simultaneously, be a total dedication in persisting as an individual and in persisting as a couple. As such, the poverty of love is an acknowledgement of the conditions of poverty that are hidden in every love affair. It is an entanglement of poverty and love, pointing out the ways we love are connected to our upbringing and therefore race, gender and class. Before touting love as a supreme virtue, it is important to ask questions of how certain scripts of love and what we recognize as higher forms of love are connected to political condition and how the capacity for one to love does not solely come from themselves, but is shaped by their social-political identity. Some political conditions allow people to be recognized as better lovers and this inequality should not suggest a difference in people’s capacity to love.  <br /><br />" +
"The poverty of love thus finds its application in two central ways: (1) as a tool of cultural critique. When we see a message which claims to represent ‘true love’ we will critically examine the way that expression of ‘true love’ is tied to political conditions: we will resist any uncritical universal expression of ‘true love’ to dominate our love, showing the ways that those expressions are poor totalizations of love itself. It is true that the white women in Atlanta exercised real love by staying with her black community-theater boyfriend, but she was on a point of privilege to do so. Awareness of the ways some are more privileged in love allow us to propose new categories of love that can be embodied by those in less fortunate economic positions. For this I propose the poverty of love as a function of (2) an aesthetic critique: through love’s poverty we advocate a new aesthetics of love: one which rejects the confinements of love to the upper-class and allows for the possibility of love to the All. Romance does not occur in the “world” of vacation trips to Barcelona in luxurious summer villas, despite what Woody Allen would like one to think—instead it advocates a romance that happens in the battleground of poverty, of struggle, of ragged-clothes, and of saintly sacrifice. Here, I return to my discussion of The Apartment  to claim that the closing scene where Bud decides to quit his job is the building blocks for a radical romantic aesthetics. To stand up to one's CEO by quitting one's job is far more romantic than any expensive wedding or candle-light dinner. The final gesture of Bud and Fran playing their card game of gin and rummy, in all its wonderful Wilderian wit and irony, is the ground work for a new aesthetics of romance. When Bud rejects traditional codes of romance in his declaration of love, he ends up creating codes for a new type of romance. His poverty of love is creating an aesthetic of love where two unemployed lovers spending their New Year’s Eve inside playing cards has as much (or even more) romantic resonance than any fancy get-away, secure pay-check or summer villas.  <br /><br />" +
"I would like to further complicate my perspective on a poverty of romance as a form of aesthetic critique of dominant romantic norms by introducing an affective dimension to it. Aesthetical concerns bring up questions relating to affectivity--aesthetical texts affect us after all. To supplant the need for new aesthetic forms of romance that are concerned with poverty as a stage for love, I also want to suggest the ability of love to rewire affective associations in order to subvert dominant relations of race, gender, and class. For example, the dominant capitalist order oftentimes creates spaces in which subjects experience a feeling of the “inappropriate”--when we feel something someone says is “inappropriate” what can be a possible result (and let me say this is not a radical condemnation of all feelings of what is inappropriate) of acting based off our affective state of the inappropriate is a perpetuation of capitalistic norms. A rather basic example is the example of a patriarch male thinking it is inappropriate for their female partner to be vulgar. Let us assume that this patriarch male is progressive and they want to allow for their female partner to be more vulgar around them and not box them into gendered categories, but their affective conditioning in the dominant culture creates a bodily repulsion to the moments when their female partner is vulgar. Through the male’s consciousness of the ways in which dominant culture creates an affective response in them in regards to their female partner, there is a possibility where they can rewire their affective orientation to their partner in specific. As a result, they could rewire their affective attitudes to the way they approach how women should behave. With this affective orientation changed, the male ultimately has become a more resistant subject to the ideological affects of capitalism. What I suggest is that the love relationship allows for these rewirings to take place--one must account for the Other for love to persistent, but accounting for the Other means to change one’s affective response to the Other. In that change, one can change their affective response to be less repressive. "

var lovelabour = "Luce Irigaray points out in I love to you, Hegel conceives of love as labor, stating that Hegel is “the only Western philosopher to have approached the question of love as labor.”  In this regard, love and labor, both concepts which have been written extensively about, have seldom been entangled. However, Irigaray critiques the concept of love’s labor as presented by Hegel because it defines love and labor by embedding them in patriarchal cultures, defining man and woman as opposites and in opposition to one another.  The opposition of man and woman becomes the motor to produce a synthesis: the family system. “Beyond the family context, Hegel shows 'little concern for granting each gender its own identity.'  In fact, Irigaray shows that the outcome of love’s labor is essentially the creation of the child who becomes the end goal (i.e. commodity) of love.  <br /><br />" + 
"For Irigaray, Hegel’s labor of love alienates women and man from one another like thesis and antithesis. For Irigaray, because women and man are divided from one another in opposition to each other, that also means that the labor they relate to one another in different terms. The labor of love, and the division that comes in labor results in a division of love between man and woman. More specifically, Irigaray points out that love’s labour confers onto women the need to exercise an abstract labor of childrearing,  showing the problem of Hegel’s labor of love with regards to women: the labor is abstract. Namely, man relates to woman in the particular: a man loves a woman, a child and so on. Meanwhile, women are doomed in Hegel’s system to exercise 'a labor of the universal in the sense that she has to love man and child without loving this man or this child.' As a result, a woman can only love by fulfilling her role as a universal Feminine, and is barred from loving in her particularities towards her beloved.<br /><br />" + 
"So one may ask why I would want to re-use the term labor of love, which is riddled with a Hegelian problematic. I believe thinking through love as labor can be productive if we are careful not to fall into the same trappings as Hegel. Specifically, it is thinking through love’s labor with regards to an outside “third” term of love that problems of woman/man oppositions can be untangled. Instead of defining man and woman in opposition to one another (where woman can only act with regards to universalisms and man only with particularisms), their identities are mediated through a Third Term: i.e. the world around the two lovers. The lovers are stripped of gender and instead gender emerges not from the way the lovers interact with one another, but the ways they mutually interact with the world and its scripts.<br /><br />" + 
"So far I have generated two ways love’s labor as a theory of the value of love based off the Labour Theory of Value that could be thought through. Marx’s labor theory of value is about how the labour put into making a commodity is a measure of how much that commodity is worth. Now ignoring all the details of the LTV and how it is economically inaccurate in many places, we use it as a way to think through love. The obvious connection between love and the LTV is that the process of world building (the Third Term) in a love affair increases the more labor is put into that process. That is, we can measure the richness of a love affair based off how much work each party has put into that relationship. Now the LTV is itself inaccurate, but it gives us a belief that the deeds we do for the lover do not disappear into the aether once they are done, but, like labor producing a commodity, help strengthen the relation between one and their lover. It is entirely the case that the work we put into love does not materialize as anything, but we can choose to believe that it matters in order to persist. Love’s labor is a belief that putting in labor for the beloved does not only benefit the beloved but also one’s relation with the beloved and the mutual world the beloved and one are building and experiencing through love.<br /><br />" + 
"Significantly, with the Third Term of love introduced, we understand that love’s labor is not simply about doing good for the lover, but about an orientation of engagement with the world itself. Namely, love’s labor is understanding the significance of the world in love, thereby taking on projects in the world in the name of love. A love affair grows based on a lover’s engagement with projects in the world. The object created in love's labor would be a 'biographical' object, that is an object 'endowed with the personal characteristics of the maker' which lives in the world alongside its maker.  Love’s labor is labor that is extracted on the world and in this way it is in the world just as much as it is for the beloved. Resultantly, it becomes a 'material affirmation' that 'reifies' a love relation, grounding it in the world, and inscribing love in time and space in a real material sense.  <br /><br />" + 
"There is also the second part of love’s labor: the constitution of joy. Like the worker in Marxist theory who is not alienated by their labor, the lover who labors experiences great joy in their laboring. Creating gifts and doing good for their beloved makes them happy. The joy of laboring for one’s beloved comes in two forms: first, the joy in doing the work itself insofar as the work is pleasurable in its execution, second, the joy of the beloved’s reaction, which, in the process of work, the lover excites themselves with through the imagining of their surprise and elation. Significantly these two joys can be contradictory. We can have no joy in the work itself but much joy in the beloved’s reaction. Similarly, we can enjoy the work, but find ourselves anxious of the beloved’s reaction (or perhaps not even show the beloved our project)—a love affair grows through the writing of an unread love letter. The unread love letter, in fact, is not a lesser version of the love letter but is its own category. <br /><br />" + 
"If we can dialectically think between these two aspects of love’s labor, then we can hope to create a love, which like happiness for De Rougemont, will resemble “the old, but no longer [belong] to the form of the world, for this new” love will “transform the world.”  That is to say, we will foster an orientation towards a life of great joy in changing the world. The projects the lover engages in, whether it be the creation of a gift, or an act of service all happen in the world and, as a result, change the world. However, we can also give the beloved the world itself as a gift, give them a world, changed, better, with an increased capacity of love. To have to choose between fighting the war or being in love finds momentary resolution. The personal becomes the political when I love those of different material conditions from myself and so, stemming from my personal love of the Other, have the will to give them a better world. You are the ghost, the specter that haunts me as I march for change. Here I am emphasizing the political aspects of 'labors of love.' I labor for love on the world for the sake of my beloved and for the sake of love itself. I labor, in utmost joy, in presenting my beloved a more loving world. Is this a world of revolution? Perhaps, necessarily so. But it is also a world of revelation. A world where, as Walter Benjamin has put, “Everything will remain the same as here—only a little bit different” —a world, where a labor of love has universal implications, where love remains love but also is a little bit different."

var lovewithoutideals = "To love without ideals is not simply to love the Other without idealizing them, but to love the Other without idealizing love itself. It is to strip love of the dust and grime that clout our eyes and look at love without preconceived notions of it. A love without ideals chooses love over Love: it asserts there is no meta-narrative which connects two loves: they are both radically singular. Generally we obtain knowledge by first living and then reflecting on what we have lived through. After a period of reflection, we abstract what we have reflected on to get a concept. Then we further refine that concept by putting it into practice in our daily life, further refining it to correspond with reality. Simply put, it is the scientific method whereby first we go through a period of observation in order to generate a hypothesis, then we go through an experiment to test this hypothesis and based off the results we go back and tinker with our hypothesis until it corresponds with lived life more. <br /> <br />" +
	"Love, however, is different. There is no science in love. In love, the change of material conditions erases the theoretical notions of love that were built out of those material conditions. 'What do I think of love?' writes Barthes 'being inside, I see it in existence, not in essence.' —that is, while we are in love, the experience of love precedes any possibility of theorizing it. Though I would add that love not only resists a theory of love, but constantly re-invents itself in its existence. We allow ourselves to not re-present our view of Love with another, but to re-create love with another, re-molding what it means to love. A philosophy of love must be replaced once again when the heart is touched by another. Every love affair requires a new philosophy of love: either as a dialectic between Two philosophies of love (me and my lover) or as a demand for the Two to create something entirely new itself, something unique outside of all loves past. <br /> <br />" +
	"Love is re-invented in its repetition. The abstract ideals of love become shaped by our day-to-day experience: and yet, those material daily conditions change as the Other to which we share our world changes. This new world, a world where love remains love but is also a little bit different,  renders lovers as mad. L'amour fou. A philosophy of love has no stable constituents, yet is plainly rooted in diurnal activity.  For Cavell, a redemption by happiness in marriage depends not 'on something that has yet to happen' but 'on a faith in something that is always happening, day by day.'  That is, for Cavell, the heart of love persists in the miracle of an everyday happenstance. He has faith in something at the heart of the day-by-day, something, which cannot quite be named, something which is not an Event, nor even a progress, but a sense of a diurnal existence, of a habitual life, which becomes the bedrock of being in love.  It is in our habits, in our day-to-day, that this love without ideals is built. <br /> <br />" +
	"'No clergyman attended' are the last words of The Sorrows of Young Werther. Barthes notes that Werther shows us our solitude in passion: no system, be it Marxist, Christian or psychoanalytical  gives us the 'recognition' to understand our mad love--we may knock on the doors of a system for recognition of our love as true but all these systems will do is surround me with 'a wall of language which oppresses and repulses me--unless I repent' and abandon my lover.  Love is outside all systems of thought, it cannot be accounted by through the clergy nor society. As a result, 'I am alone in marking a system out of' love --in fact I must make a system, a new system for my love to persist, lest I become like unfortunate Werther. <br /> <br />" +
	"When love shatters, it shatters the remains of one’s old heart, supplanting it with a new heart, radically unseen, created between the space of two lovers. To love anew is to love with a transplanted heart. In the lover’s touch, one’s old heart shatters and the possibility of filling this hole comes from a whole new philosophy of love. This shattering does not have to take place instantaneously, but can be a gradual scattering, a shedding of a past love: fundamentally though it is a difference which occurs in repetition. Love without ideals is the re-birth of love, it is when love is birthed again, wiped of all memory of its past, reincarnated, yet always tied to its history. A love affair goes differently every time: the same motions, the same scripts, but somehow everything is different. It is like watching a movie at several different stages in one’s life: the experience of watching the film is different depending on the cultural and personal context one views it in. Love is like that: though one can put all their lovers under the same experience of love, each persistence of love differs, each ‘I love you’ is different to each lover. One loves another in a different way for each lover and this becomes the bedrock for a different love.<br /> <br />" +
	"To love is to love beyond the beyond itself. It is to love beyond the Other, but also to love beyond the concept of “beyond”, to go past a transcendence of a stable Ideal of what love should be and allow love to develop however it does with the other in the day-to-day movements of life."

var persistance = "ON THE PERSISTANCE OF LOVE <br />" + 
	
	"Outside paradise, pleasure, and passion. The persistence of love is the thinking of love past the abstract impossibilities which make love possible. It is the moment of a lover's discourse when love is in danger, the call to keep persisting, even when it may seem difficult or impossible to do so. It is the moment of going on when it is impossible to go on going on. Thinking of the persistence of love is not thinking when love runs smoothly, but when lovers yearn for survival: when lovers echoing Samuel Beckett, proclaim 'I can’t go on, I’ll go on.'  Love needs to persist in the moment it is challenged. The persistence of love is the perseverance of love. To think of love’s persistence means to also think of love in the everyday. It is in the background of the everyday where the impossibility of persistence emerges. The everyday material conditions ground love and are the grounds for love. The miracle of love itself is that it invades our everyday lives, but at the same time, the everyday is the fabric to which love finds its expression. In the battleground of mundanity what does it mean to love? To persist in love is to persist in time and space, it is to persist in our material condition, and it is to re-fall and re-affirm love, day by day. <br /><br />" + 
	
	"The persistence of love is a re-presence of love—it is something which repeats yet is also 'new'. Love is a metonym for cinema. If our previous chapter tied love’s insistence with the ontology of the photograph, then love’s persistence is about the rolling of the film reel—it is the unfolding of the reel to us. Love’s persistence is love in real life, outside the abstract ideals, reelly enfolding in our material conditions. The persistence of love opens up to the truth of love. True love is living in the truth of love. That is, the persistence of love is not about the survival of a love affair, but also about the ways in which a love affair can express the truth of love. <br /><br />" +
		
	"For Badiou, the truth of love involves the irreducible singularity, of an Encounter which starts an amourous encounter.  Though this Encounter is singular only to the lovers, it has universal consequences for all of humanity.  That is why the “you” in the omnipresent love pop song feels personal despite being generic. Every love song speaks of love in its universalism but also its personal dimensions. In the practice of love, a speaker of love reflects their own relations to love but also makes universal claims of love. So on the one hand, learning of love is learning how to love from one's teacher. On the other hand, it is also learning about love itself. More radically, love for Badiou becomes a grand project attached with the function of humanity itself: the love of two lovers makes a space where the Two learn each other’s way of loving to create a synthesis without unity. <br /><br />" + 
	
	"Perhaps love is like Derrida's concept of democracy—a 'democracy to come,' that will never 'truly' arrives but functions as an injunction that one always pursues . True love never becomes true, that is why there is an injunction to pursue its truth. True love is impossible—we can never be or live out the truth of love. It is distant to us, only arriving in the end times, in the world we cannot yet think. Instead of pursuing a truth of love, the persistence of love triangulates the real of love—real love not true love. We look at love which is real, not one which is true (though of course there is truth in it), but one constituted by the real life of love, by the messiness of it and not by the apotheosis of truth offered by Badiou in his vision of love.

	Welcome to the 'Persistance of Love,' a graphic visualization of chapter two of my book titled 'P.S. (Post-Structurialism) Letters of Love and Cinema'. 
	I should probably explain somethings about this project. Essentially, I am trying to produce a non-linear 'rhizomic' form of theory. Each node is a piece of theory, and they are related to each other. A node is directly related to its neighbors--meaning, the theoretical concepts built upon in that node are developed (to some extent) in its neighbors.
	<br /><br />
	I see it as a game. You, the reader, start at 'On the Persistance of Love.'
	Once you finish reading it, you can 'travel' to any of the nodes which are connected to 'On the Persistance of Love.' In this case, you can travel to 'Performativity (Cavell and Remarriage),' 'The War (Pynchon and The Matrix),' and 'World Agency (Badiou, Iragaray, Cavell).'
	And then, once you read one of those nodes, you can go to any of the nodes they are neighbouring. I see this visualization as a subway system, where each node is a stop in the subway station. You, the reader, are riding the subway. Imagine yourself going from node to node. Because you are a human (I assume), you cannot skip nodes, but are condemned 
	to ride them one at a time. In this way, the different colors of the subway stations can be seen as analogous to 'lines'.
	<br /><br />
	You can travel the 'Blue' line' from 'The War(Pynchon and the Matrix)' all the way to 'Politics of Love (Badiou, Zizek)' before it turns into the Green line.
	You will notice that the first three subway lines you encounter are 'Red,' 'Blue,' and 'Yellow'--these are the primary colours. As the structure becomes more complicated, different colour lines are introduced (the 'Green' and 'Orange' line).
	These lines are created by 'mixing' the colors of previous lines--so if the 'Blue' line and the 'Yellow' line both end in the same stop, then everything after that stop becomes the 'Green' line. This is the case with the 'Politics of Love (Badiou, Zizek),' where the Yellow and Blue line converge to it.
	So you travel from the Blue, Red, or Yellow line until they become more complex and turn into 'Orange' or 'Green.'
	
	<br /><br />
	The end goal is to travel to the node 'Unconditional Love(Saint Bernard, Freud)' and 'Poverty of Love(Berlant and Atlanta).' To do this, you will need to backtrack. Once you travel to both of these nodes (this involves reading every node on the your to the them!), click on the node 'Love without Ideals(Barthes, Goethe),' which will 'close' this chapter.
	After you do that, you can ride this subway system again and see the other nodes you missed your first time through! 
	<br /><br />
	Everytime you refresh the page, the positions of the nodes are randomized. However, I recommend reorganizing the nodes (this is easily done by dragging them), such that there is ample space between them all. To get started, click on the node 'On the Persistance of Love.'
